# Favicon Setup Instructions

To complete the favicon setup, you'll need to generate the following files and place them in the `public/` directory:

## Required Favicon Files:

1. **favicon.ico** (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 - multi-size ICO file)
2. **favicon-16x16.png** (16x16 PNG)
3. **favicon-32x32.png** (32x32 PNG)
4. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180 PNG)
5. **android-chrome-192x192.png** (192x192 PNG)
6. **android-chrome-512x512.png** (512x512 PNG)
7. **mstile-150x150.png** (150x150 PNG for Windows tiles)
8. **og-image.png** (1200x630 PNG for social media sharing)

## How to Generate:

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator
1. Go to https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. Upload a high-quality square image (at least 512x512px)
3. Customize settings as needed
4. Download the generated files
5. Place them in the `public/` directory

### Option 2: Create Manually
1. Start with a high-quality square logo/image (1024x1024px recommended)
2. Use design tools like Figma, Photoshop, or GIMP to resize
3. Export each size as PNG (except favicon.ico)
4. Use an ICO converter for the favicon.ico file

## Design Recommendations:
- Use your personal logo or initials "AA"
- Purple theme (#8b5cf6) to match your site
- Simple, recognizable design that works at small sizes
- High contrast for visibility

## Social Media Image (og-image.png):
- Size: 1200x630px
- Include your name and title
- Use your brand colors
- Keep text readable and centered
- This appears when your site is shared on social media

Once you have these files, your site will have:
✅ Proper favicons for all devices
✅ Social media preview images
✅ PWA capabilities
✅ Windows tile support
