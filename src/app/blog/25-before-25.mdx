# 25 before 25

> I made a list of 25 things to do before turning 25 and I think you should do the same.

Scrolling through twitter (or X i guess?) last week, I stumbled upon a tweet that got me thinking. Ibrahim one of the founders of Deen Developers and someone who I highly respect for all the amazing work he does in supporting the muslim tech community shared a tweet on his "30 before 30" journey. He was turning 28 and hadn't made as much progress on his list as he hoped. The concept of such lists isn't new to me, but for some reason, this time it really made me pause and reflect.

Why not make my own list? I'm 22, and while "30 before 30" sounds cool, it feels a bit too distant. So, I landed on "25 before 25." It's a tight timeframe, sure—just over 2 years to go. But it feels just right for adding a bit of pressure without being too overwhelming.

Creating my "25 before 25" list turned out to be quite the introspective journey. Typically I tend to bounce between long-term dreams and the immediate to-dos, zeroing in on what I want in the next few years ended up being a journey of self-discovery. Interestingly, some of the goals that landed on my list were ones I'd previously waved off as fleeting thoughts and ideas. Yet, here they were, taking centre stage, proving they held more significance in my grand scheme of things than I'd ever given them credit for.

It's kinda like I discovered these repressed ambitions, things I brushed away due to a mix of skepticism and pragmatism. It turns out, those 'passing thoughts and desires' were not so fleeting after all.

## What made it to my list?

While I cherish the idea of sharing, there's a part of me that believes in the sanctity of personal ambitions—thus spoiler-alert, I won't be unveiling the entirety of my "25 before 25" list. However, I'm open to offering a glimpse into the key themes that surfaced during the process of the lists creation.

### 1. Relationships and Family

This section is fundamentally about cherishing time with my nearest and dearest—both friends and family. It's focused on deepening those personal ties and fostering connections that are rich and meaningful.

### 2. Career and Finances

Honestly I'm surprised this section wasn't more of my goals, if you had asked me 2 years ago this would have been a significant portion of the list but thankfully I've over-achieved on a lot of my pre-25 career ambitions already and want to take a step off the hedonic treadmill as I transition into a different stage of my life. Having said all that theres definitely still some key goals and ambitions I want to achieve.

### 3. Adventure/Travel

It's hard to imagine a 22-year-old who doesn't wish for travel and adventure, and I'm no exception. My aim is to immerse myself in unique experiences and soak up the diverse cultures our world has to offer. I aspire to be that person who always has a fascinating story to tell, leaving everyone a bit astonished by the sheer variety and peculiarity of my life experiences.

### 4. Health and Fitness

This area is particularly critical for me right now, as I find myself at a personal low in terms of physical health and fitness. It's time for a serious lifestyle overhaul to prioritise my well-being. As a Muslim, I believe in the importance of treating our bodies with care and respect, a principle I've admittedly overlooked lately. My goal is to rejuvenate my health, ensuring I lead a long and fulfilling life.

### 5. Personal Development

My passion for learning and an unending quest for self-improvement guide this focus area. I deeply believe in the transformative power of compounding growth when it comes to personal development. I want to be someone who constantly evolves and enhances my skills, knowledge, and emotional intelligence.

### 6. Islam & Spirituality

My faith is the bedrock of my existence, guiding me through life's ups and downs. This part of the list is deeply personal, reflecting my desire to strengthen my connection with the divine and to live my life in a way that's aligned with Islamic values. It's about deepening my understanding of Islam, practicing mindfulness, and cultivating a sense of peace and purpose.

It was fascinating to see that the themes that emerged from my "25 before 25" list pretty much covered everything that I would value or consider important in life.

## What did I learn from doing this exercise?

### There is clarity in setting intention

Creating my "25 before 25" list taught me the invaluable lesson of clarity in intention. As I sifted through my desires, distinguishing fleeting wishes from genuine goals, I uncovered what truly matters to me. This exercise in intentionality wasn't just about setting targets; it was figuring out my short-term aspirations, fears, and the person I wish to be. It reminded me that clarity comes from action, and action begins with a clear intention.

### Holding yourself accountable is only possible when you know where to start

Jumping into making my "25 before 25" list really shone a light on how key it is to keep myself in check. During this process I came across some stats from the Association for Talent Development that really hit home:

**Just Having an Idea or Goal:** 10% likelihood of success.

**Deciding The Time Frame For the Goal:** 40%.

**Planning How To Achieve it:** 50%.

**Committing by Telling Someone You Will Do It:** 65%.

**Setting and Attending Accountability Appointments:** 95%.

Pretty wild stats right? It's not just about scribbling down a bunch of goals. Making my list was step one on the road to actually living out those dreams. It's all about planning, committing, and then keeping myself honest with regular check-ups on how I'm doing.

What I've learned is that laying out my goals is just the start. The next point is sticking to the plan, reflecting on my progress, and tweaking things as I go. Making sure each goal isn't just another item on my to-do list but something I'm genuinely moving towards. Getting into the habit of checking in on myself and adjusting my game plan is what's going to take me from just dreaming about it to actually doing it.

## Why I think you should make a list too

Well if what I've said so far hasn't already got you thinking about making your own "x before x" list let me summarise exactly why I think you should do one too.

It's a moment of self reflection, a pausing of ordinary life to focus on what is really important to you over the next few years. It's easy to get caught up in the hustle of everyday life and forget the more important things like why we're doing it all. With a list you've got a clear roadmap of what you want to achieve. Plus it'll be fun to look back on when you're older and see what past you used to deem as important. How much have you changed? Or maybe, how much have you stayed the same?

Those stats don't lie (cue Shakira in the background - jk it's ramadan go do dhikr). The chances of hitting your goals skyrocket when you not only jot down your goals but also loop in a someone for accountability, or just set regular dates to check in with yourself. It's like promising your future self you won't forget what's important to you. But you can only do that after you do step one which is having the goals written up and planned for in the first place.

So, why not? Whether you're feeling stuck, looking for a bit of direction, or just want to challenge yourself, a "25 before 25," "40 before 40," or any "x before x" list could be the kickstart you need.
