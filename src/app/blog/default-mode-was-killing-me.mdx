> For 151 days, I let default mode run my life. Easy choices. Path of least resistance. It was killing me slowly.

171 days. That's how far into my 24th rotation around the sun I am. And quite honestly, About 151 of those days have not been my favourite. In fact, they've probably been on the lower end of the spectrum of my overall life.

For most of that time (and probably much longer), I was living on autopilot. Default mode. Taking the easy option, every single time. Order takeout instead of cooking. Skip the walk. Scroll instead of read. Ignore the problem instead of addressing it.

But over the last 20 days, I've been focusing on turning that around.

## The job change

Part of this reset has been a job change. I left a company whose culture I was not vibing with (especially after a good manager and some key decision makers left) and joined an incredibly exciting UK-based startup called [V7 Labs](https://www.v7labs.com/).

V7 is exactly what I wanted when I decided to job search: a UK-based startup with under 200 people (they're at about 80), where I get to have real impact as a platform engineer. High level of learning, high level of autonomy, and a company I can genuinely see going to the moon. Plus, I get to work at the forefront of agentic AI, which is pretty cool. And hopefully I'll make a handsome sum on my shares along the way.

That shift alone has been massive. Leaving something that wasn't working and jumping into something that actually excites me has been one of the better decisions I've made recently.

## The wake-up call

I've been here before. There have been several points where I commit to making a change and never last more than 30 days.

But this time feels different. I know I'm only 20 days in, but the activation energy is lower, the friction is lower, and the consciousness of reality is higher.

Here's what clicked: I like to consider myself in the top decile for most things in life, and I actively try to make sure that remains true. But when I actually looked at my overall health and appearance? I was definitely falling towards the bottom decile.

That realisation hit different.

I couldn't reconcile being someone who strives for excellence in most areas of my life while completely neglecting my physical health. The cognitive dissonance was too much. I had to either lower my standards everywhere else, or raise my standards for my health.

And I wasn't willing to lower my standards.

## The default mode problem

I'm someone who needs routine and stability to operate. When I don't have structure, I definitely see the negative effects on my mental health and overall joy. For most of those 151 days, routine had fallen to the wayside. And with it, my sense of contentment, schedule, and general order.

When structure goes, default mode takes over. And default mode, for me, means choosing whatever's easiest in the moment. Which is almost never what's actually good for me.

## The reset: my daily checklist

Over the last 20 days, I've implemented a checklist of standard items I must complete. If I don't, I can't call it a successful day.

It sounds rigid. It is rigid. But honestly, having these non-negotiables has been exactly what I needed.

### Movement: 8,000 steps minimum

I work a mainly WFH desk job, so if I don't consciously make an effort, my step count doesn't get anywhere close to 8,000. This one simple rule has forced me to actually move my body. Take breaks, go for walks, not just sit at my desk for 10 hours straight.

The difference in how I feel at the end of the day is noticeable.

### Hydration: 2 litres of water

Simple but effective. I used to be really good at drinking water, but since hitting my 20s I just... don't. Now I'm actually tracking it. Skin is better, energy is better, just generally functioning better. Groundbreaking stuff, I know.

### Hair protocols

This one might sound oddly specific, but it's about managing my health conditions. I'm focusing on certain vitamins, drinking spearmint tea daily, and trying to balance my thyroid and PCOS issues so my hair remains healthy.

It's not just about vanity. It's about taking care of my body in a way that actually addresses the health issues I'm dealing with.

### Nutrition: calories, macros, and actually paying attention

I've become far more conscious of what I consume. Now focused on high protein, moderate fat and carbs, and hitting fat levels that are actually good for PCOS and thyroid issues. Women generally need more fat and fewer carbs than men for hormone regulation, and I hadn't been paying attention to that at all.

I'm also focusing on a calorie deficit. I didn't quite realise how much I let this falter over the years. How much I've been eating shit food in a significant surplus for over 5 years.

It's wild how you can just... blatantly ignore these things until you actually start tracking. I knew what I was doing wasn't great, but I kept choosing to ignore it because addressing it felt too hard.

### Reading: 10 pages a day

I'm committing to a minimum of 10 pages a day. It's a small goal, but it's one I can hit consistently. And those pages add up. Some days I'll read 50 or 100 pages because I don't want to put the book down.

I've always loved reading but let it fall by the wayside when life got busy. Now it's back on the list, and I'm actually making progress through books again. Instead of just buying them and letting them sit on my shelf. (We've all been there.)

## How I'm tracking everything

I'm trying to reduce friction and keep things simple, so I'm using tools that actually work for me.

For macros and calories, I use MacroFactor. It's an app by Jeff Nippard, a science-based lifter and fitness YouTuber. It's been a game changer because it actually adapts to my metabolism and gives me real data instead of just generic calorie targets. The science-based approach appeals to me, and it removes a lot of the guesswork.

For my daily checklist? I just use Notes. Simple checkboxes. No fancy apps, no overcomplicated systems. If it's too complicated, I won't do it. So Notes it is. I can check things off throughout the day, and at the end I can see what I've accomplished.

I also made it my phone homescreen. So every time I unlock my phone, there it is. Staring at me. Can't ignore it as easily when it's literally the first thing I see.

## Setbacks and imperfect days

Some days I don't close every item. That's okay. But I have rules.

Out of my 8 tasks, I can't have more than 2 unchecked. And I can't leave the same ones unchecked for more than 1 day in a row.

This gives me flexibility without letting me completely slide. I can have an off day, but I can't have an off week. I can miss something once, but I can't make a habit of missing the same thing repeatedly.

Progress, not perfection. But also: not letting myself make excuses.

## Hobbies that bring me joy

Beyond the checklist, I'm also trying to spend more time on activities that actually bring me joy. This isn't just about productivity or optimisation. It's about actually enjoying my life.

I've also had a bit of a mindset shift around spending money on myself. I've realised that spending on things that improve my health and longevity, and things I genuinely find cool, is a valid way to spend money. Especially if they're developing skills that will stay with me for life.

The private members club membership, the archery lessons, the chess and Urdu classes. These aren't frivolous expenses. They're investments in becoming a more interesting, healthier, more capable version of myself. And that's worth it.

### Swimming: 2-3 times a week

I got a membership at a hefty-priced private members club so I can swim in a relatively quiet, well-maintained pool and exercise in a nice gym. It's paying off in how I feel. Swimming has always been something that clears my head, and I'm finally making time for it consistently.

### Archery lessons

I signed up for archery lessons. Something I've always wanted to do. Haven't started yet, but it's booked, and I'm actually excited about it.

Why archery? It's a sunnah sport, for one. But also, I read a lot of books as a kid, and archery was always there as this common, elegant weapon. I always thought it was cool. Plus, seems like a useful skill to have in the event of an apocalypse. You never know.

No more "I'll do it someday." I'm doing it now.

### Reading

Reading is back in my life in a real way. With the 10 pages a day commitment, I'm actually making progress through the stack of books I've been meaning to read. Right now I'm working through *The New Wilderness* and *The Forty Rules of Love*, both given to me by my best friend (shout out Asfa).

It's not about speed or volume. It's about consistency and actually engaging with ideas and stories again. There's something really satisfying about finishing a book you've been working through page by page.

### Chess and Urdu lessons

I have my first chess and Urdu lessons booked for the early new year. So I can finally start doing all the things I say I will.

Urdu is a beautiful language, and I've always wanted to be able to read Urdu poetry. My grandad used to keep a book of Dr Iqbal's poems, and I was never able to read and enjoy it. That's always stayed with me.

And as a programmer and overall nerd, I've always found it a bit embarrassing that I'm not any good at chess. Time to fix that.

These are both things I've wanted to learn for ages. And I'm tired of them just being things I talk about wanting to do.

## Why this matters

I know this all sounds like a very detailed list of personal habits. But the bigger picture is that I'm taking control again.

Those 151 days felt like I was just reacting to life instead of actively shaping it. These last 20 days of having structure and intention have already made a difference. My mood is better. The fatigue is lifting. And there's something about actively making harder choices, instead of just defaulting to the easy option, that makes me feel better about myself.

It's not about perfection. Some days I don't hit everything on the list. But having the list means I'm at least trying. And that's more than I was doing before.

The next 194 days are crucial. I want to look, feel, and act like a significantly better version of myself by my 25th birthday. That's it. That's the goal.

I'm 171 days into 24, and I'm determined to make the rest of this year better than the first 151 days. Sometimes you just need to turn off default mode, create some structure, and start showing up for yourself again.

Here's to the next 194 days.

I'll probably write an update once I'm 90-100 days into this. Stay tuned.
